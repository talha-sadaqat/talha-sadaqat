Computer science has helped revolutionize the world making life easier and work more productive for businesses. I have spent my life in Dubai, 
a country that is involving digital technology and artificial intelligence in almost every system, smart driving test, smart police stations, robotic surgery and many more. 
Surrounded by automation and computers made me fall in love with computer science and I would always get personal satisfaction whenever I would help my teachers and classmates
with setting up PC equipmentâ€™s at school.

Through my education, I have developed a wide range of technical skills that will help me to succeed in this role. My Bachelor of Computer Science has placed emphasis on 
practical designing of software with analytic tools of C, C++, and JAVA. This allowed me to take a systematic approach to work and has improved my ability to anticipate 
and diagnose problems. Moreover, I helped with Installing and configuring computer hardware, software, systems, networks, printers, and scanners at my school 
during the Science fair. In my advance programming course, I designed a Bus Reservation program that allowed users to book seats on a bus. Furthermore, I also 
developed an investments record software along with its graphical user interface using JAVA to keep track for buying or selling investments, searching for investments, updating prices, 
calculating total gain and much more. I created a very efficient error free program and received constructive feedback from my professor.

Additionally, my completion of a Duke of Edinburgh International Award has boosted my leadership skills and enhanced my public speaking skills. This award required me to 
speak publicly to groups of various sizes, allowing me to demonstrate confidence and ability to craft convincing and engaging messages. Furthermore, I was the captain of the 
sports club in which I led and provided training to around 250 students which resulted us in winning the annual sports day.

My advance and efficient programming ability and computer hardware knowledge along with my strong leadership skills, will make me a valuable member of your team.
I would appreciate the opportunity to have an interview with you to discuss the position further and thank you for your consideration.
